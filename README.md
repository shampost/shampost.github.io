This github account is a personal repository for all my personal projects, ranging from games to data science dashboards.

This repository hosts my personal portfolio website where you can find more a general overview of my work and experience.

To clone this repo to my local machine, I used Github Desktop, signed into my account, and added via URL, as it was not directly available in the dropdown selection.
